My scoop bucket
===============

Some of these are personal setups, others are more generally useful and I might
try and get them merged into the main buckets.

If you haven't seen [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) yet, check it
out - it's a cmd line program installer for Windows, somewhat like Chocolatey
but simpler and, I think, nicer.
